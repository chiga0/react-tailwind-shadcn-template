# Vite Template For React + Tailwindcss + Shadcn + ReactRouter

We create this template for React + Tailwindcss + Shadcn + ReactRouter. You can use this template for your project.

## How to start
You can get this template without forking/cloning the repo and just use `degit`:
```bash
npx degit chiga0/react-tailwind-shadcn-template your-project
```

The template contains mostly the minimum dependencies to start a new project. And also includes eslint and prettier to make sure you project is clean.

```bash
# for npm
npm install

# for yarn
yarn

# for pnpm
pnpm install
```

You can just run `npm run dev` to start the project. It will auto run the project in your browser.

While the dev server is running, you can edit the files in the `src` directory and the browser will update automatically.
